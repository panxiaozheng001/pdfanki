 * Syntax highlighting, which the library refuses on purpose.
 *
 * `@ankimd/core` takes a highlighter and never imports one, so a library consumer
 * does not pull a language table and a stylesheet along with a deck converter. This
 * is where the table and the stylesheet live.
 *
 * The colouring happens once, here, at build time. Nothing is injected into the deck
 * to run inside Anki: the classes Prism emits are styled by the CSS the note type
 * carries, so the card is coloured with no script in it at all.
 *
 * A second copy of `ankimd/cli/src/highlight.ts`, deliberately. `@ankimd/cli`
 * exports only `main`, so the alternative was inheriting its yargs and fast-glob
 * to reach this. A fix here is worth carrying to the other; the root `AGENTS.md`
 * says so where both are named.
 */

 * A key's own value, or `undefined`.
 *
 * The key here is a fence's info string, which is whatever the deck's author typed.
 * A plain `record[key]` reaches `Object.prototype`, so a fence tagged `constructor`
 * finds a function in both tables below. Neither read is exploitable today, since
 * Prism hands such code back escaped, but a lookup driven by text out of a deck has
 * no business seeing a prototype at all.
